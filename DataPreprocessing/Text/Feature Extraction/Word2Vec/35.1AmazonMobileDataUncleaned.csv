"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?",positive
"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest.",positive
"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...",positive
"I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)",positive
"The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time.",positive
"Hello, I have this phone and used it until I decided to buy a flip phone. I have had NO problems with the battery or new cases--it has a new fish case on it now and it stays as well as the original one. I have added ring tones, and music so it was all good for me--as a matter of fact I am willing to sell this phone, the home charger and the car charger for a great deal--email me--(...)",positive
"Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget. And oh, if you're thinking of getting this for a teenager, you've come to the right phone; they'll go crazy after its looks AND its color LCD (which happens to be a little oversize). If this phone's goin' for an adult, you've hit da soda pop again, you lucky person! NOW are ya convinced that this mobile's REAL! (it is).",positive
"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset.",positive
"I've never owned a Nokia phone before, so this is a first for me. I really like the phone alot, the reception is great...even though the signal strength show's being low. The quality of the phone is great too, it feels sturdy and weighted. I highly recommend this phone.",positive
ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.,negative
"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.",positive
"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.",positive
"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",negative
This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,positive
I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.,positive
"I just got it and have to say its easy to use, i can hear the person talking just fine and i have had no problems dealing with nextel.",positive
1 star because the phones locked so I have to pay additional fees to unlock it ,negative
The product has been very good. I had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders. I will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it....,positive
"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.",positive
GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS AS GREAT FOR NEXTEL AS IT IS FOR BOOST INSERT YOUR SIM & GO!,positive
"I bought this phone to replace an LG phone that I didn't like. As I expected, all I had to do was put the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked. There are two serious drawbacks to this device, both related to the candy bar style. First, all the buttons are exposed, so it's easy to hit one accidentally. Second, the screen is easily scratched. This one got scratched making it difficult to read in sunlight. Aside from those two flaws, the phone works great. Connectivity, battery life, and quality of voice are superb. Since I don't do texting I can't comment on that. It is nice and small, and if it came with a case, or if I could find a case for it, then it would be perfect for my needs. The price was right. Now I have a new SIM card with $10 worth of calling on it that I don't need.",positive
"I purchased this phone for my AT&T phone replacement, even though one of the FAQ mentioned it works with AT&T SIM, in my case, it didn't. Since this is my primary phone, in stead of spending time to see the reason, I'll go with other phone, which specifically says it's ""unlocked"".",negative
SERVED ME WELL AS A BACK UP PHONE.,positive
I got this phone just as secondary cell phone. It is really lightweight and very cheap. The receiption is good. But most of the time a windy noise is heard when somebody is calling to this cell phone.,positive
Sturdy - clarity is great - easy to use Only problem - no Speaker option...... Big issue for me but im living with it atm.,positive
It does a beautiful job. I have used this item with my att account. its good to see my bill so little and avoided big amount of bills..i would recommend this product to any body. Very good quality it really met my expectations,positive
"I asked my friend to toss me my phone, but what he heard was ""Hey, throw that phone as hard as you can at my head"", so he did. Hit me square in the temple and I dropped. Needless to say this is a very sturdy phone, very simple and easy to use, long battery life (Like really long, like Stretch Armstrong long), takes being dropped and smacked around like a champ. If this phone was my son, i'd be proud, and afraid. The texting takes a little to get used to, but I digress. Smart Phones are for dummies. P.S you can create your own ringtones on this phone, provides way more entertainment than Flappy Bird.",positive
"We never use cell phones, but thought we needed one for a long road trip. With our last phone we were always irritated that the battery seemed to be dead every time we tried to use it. Based on reviews, we chose this phone. Battery life is great! And the phone really does handle abuse very well. My husband forgot it was in his shirt pocket. The phone went through the washer and dryer and still works as well as ever!! I'm not sure how it would work as an everyday phone, but for those who only need it occasionally I would highly recommend. It will be there, charged and ready when you need it.",negative
"I have had this model phone for 4-1/2 years and only now the battery is beginning to fail. FANTASTIC little phone that doesn't drop calls, can stick in a pocket or purse easily, does exactly what it is supposed to do at an unbeatable price. Refill for $100 and get a bonus $5.",positive
"Easy to use features, slim in size at a very good price. It is better compare to my exsiting T-Mobile prepaid phone. I called from a landline to both phones and the at& t picked up within 13 seconds while the T-Mobile at 25 sec or most of the time, just jumped to my voice mail only. I highly recommend at&t.",positive
"This phone is great. Simple to use, great battery life, always has a strong signal and AT&T has a great pay-as-you go plan. I'm happy.",positive
It is just a basic phone and is an effective phone for people who do not need a lot of features. The size is good.,positive
"this is a good little inexpensive phone - basic, but that's what I wanted! Just a phone for my pay as you go plan!",positive
"I almost never write reviews for anything, but this stupid little cheap phone has proven so reliable and indestructible that I just had to say something. I bought this phone at least 3 (maybe 4) years ago, after two ""fancy"" (expensive) flip phones each lasted less than a year before falling apart. My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn't expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years. My goal was just not to spend $150 on another phone. I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out. Four generations of iPhone later, I still don't have one, because this phone has refused to die. Incredible.",negative
"I've been using this phone for about three weeks, now, and it truly is a nice little phone. It's small, light, and the keypad and screen really light up...you can actually see the screen in very bright sunlight! It does everything I want a phone to do. The graphics on the web are really very good, although accessing the web is rather slow. The keypad IS quite small, and this could be a problem for most men, but it's perfect for me. The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability. The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on. It's a simple matter of pushing two keys to turn on the lock or to shut it off, and sure saves a lot of battery life.",positive
"I have had the C168i for two years as a replacement for a different phone I broke. Note that it is a ""goPhone"" but you can use any monthly ATT service with it just by putting your SIM card in. My friends make fun of me for my boring looking phone, but they have since gone through 4-5 $150-200 phones while my $20 ""crap"" phone is still going and going... This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't need a camera, videos, bell and whistles stuff, but wants a sturdy reliable phone with a long battery life. It is also very inexpensive. Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a ""TERMINATOR"" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm. I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting. The only complaint I would make is that entering new contacts into the address book is somewhat difficult and counter-intuitive until you learn how to do it. You won't regret buying this phone.",positive
"Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2 one for an emergency replacement.",positive
"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.",negative
"I needed a temporary phone for a friend in a retirement home until he got settled in his new place. I charged it up and it ran for several days on its own. He would have preferred a larger key pad due to his poor eyesight, but he seemed to do okay with it, and it was simple enough for him to be able to use it to simply make or receive calls (I didn't get into the answering system with him!). Now that he has moved and has his landline installed, I am giving it to a friend who has no cell phone, and cannot afford the price of a regular one. This will be just right for her limited calls when she is on the road. So.... two for the price of one!!",positive
"I've owned this phone now for 5 years and have just replaced it due to its age and me beating the tar out of it. Doesn't look like it will be available for much longer as it is no longer in production. I'm not interested in owning a smart phone, don't get me wrong I love new technologies I'm just not a fan of all-in-one devices that you can't swap or upgrade components on. So on that thought a phone should be a phone and a tablet should just be a tablet. Overall this phone is durable, rugged and offers some easy to use features that allow you to carry a few less ""tools"" when you are moblie.",negative
"I highly doubt this phone is a genuine Nokia product. The battery door does not fit properly, the battery fits but the plastic guard on the side opposite the contacts is separated once inserting the battery due to poor fit. This is not nokia quality your used to, it must be some sort of a clone. Packaging looks authentic albeit generic. Totally disappointed by this purchase",negative
"Over the past decade I have been through half a dozen cell phones. With a brief (and unsatisfactory) PANASONIC interlude, I have always gone NOKIA and did not regret it. My previous phone was NOKIA 6230i, a stylish working horse that, after three years of non-stop use, lately kept having ringer failure. I loved my phone and, although realized its time was up, did not want to have to familiarize myself with a whole different Menu SetUp. The NOKIA 6500-SLIDER was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful and robust brushed-steel finish, a large screen of impressive quality and one of the best phone cameras available (a 3.2Mpixels sensor behind an autofocus Carl Zeiss lens with flash). An important detail: the brushed steel is NOT that sensitive to fingerprint marks and will not require the constant wiping that other metal models do. The menu is intuitive and easy to use even if new to NOKIA 6-series. The buttons are large enough for adult fingers and, important for a slider phone, even the top buttons are fully accessible. Like most NOKIAs, the phone is greatly customizable, from colors and sounds to wallpapers and screensavers. It is robustly built and the slider glides easily in place with zero wobbling. NOKIA 6500-SLIDER is a beautiful phone that can be your helper for years. My only complaints are actually...three: (1) the very limited OnBoard memory (it has only 20MB - when my older 6230i had almost double that). Since only mp3s and photos stored on the Phone memory are guarantied to work when used as ring-tones or contact/group images, to have a cavernous 256MB Memory Card yet a puny 20MB OnBoard capacity seems ironic. (2) the placement of the speakerphone in the...back of the phone. Activate it and the phone speaks to your desk, voices coming out all muffled; and (3) the absence of photo stabilization. It may seem excessive for a phone, however when increasing the pixel number beyond 3M, image stabilization is actually essential if photos of any value are to be taken. All in all, an excellent stylish phone that, (six months after its initial release) should be available at bargain prices.",positive
I have had very good experiences with Nokia phones but we've had this thing repaired 3 times in the last year and it just went dead. I'm going to something else.,negative
"The quality of this Nokia 6300 slide, I was going to have as a souvenir, is completely different from the one used to be when I had it brand new in 2008 which was made not in China. This one looks and feels really crappy. The picture on the screen is not straight with the body shape of the devise, the sell phone feels much lighter as compared with it used to be. The back cover was damaged when I first take the sell phone out to put the battery in.",negative
"This phone isn't kidding when it says military specs. I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar. I often keep it in my pants pocket (the front pocket).",negative
I bought this phone and found out IDEN phones with sim cards are no longer eligible for service with Boost Mobile. So buyer be ware dont buy these unless you already have service with a sim card.,positive
i wont ( enter special code ),negative
my mother said that she loves Walkie Talkie Phones so what i did was i bought this for my mother Denise Avellan for mothers day of 2014 and my mother loves it. what a great Direct Connect Connection!!!!!!,positive
Bought this phone only to be told it would no longer work on network. Waste of money and seller knew they would not work and did not say anything.,negative
For the price you really get a solid boost motorola phone. Sounds and looks good.,positive
"PHONE DID NOT COME WITH A SIM CARD....INFORMATION I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE..... PHONE WORKS FINE, BUT BECAUSE PTT (WALKIE) IS BEING PHASED-OUT ON BOOST, NO SIM. RATING IS FOR PHONE, BUT VERY UNHAPPY NOT TO HAVE ALL THE FACTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE.",positive
"This is not a ""boost"" phone and will not work as a GPS with Boost. Had to send it back. A huge pain for something that is $24. This is a rip-off.",negative
good phone works well. very simple to use.dropped a few times and still works fine.,positive
"You get the basic functions for what a cell phone is needed for, in other words this phone is simple and effective.",positive
Wouldn't know anything about the cell phone I ordered because the person hasn't even shipped it yet. It's been a month! And amazon has does nothing to help and really has nothing for an option to provide assistance.,negative
"For someone needing a very basic phone and services (i.e., no email access, no camera, etc.) this phone is quite good. The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above. If someone is looking for a barebones phone this is more than fulfills the requirements.",positive
"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.",negative
"I picked this up to use with Boost Mobile. All I wanted was a phone with walkie talkie and this fit the bill. I have a digital camera for pictures, phones don't need a camera. This phone has not dropped one call since I activated it. Everytime I DT with someone it works. This phone gets a signal where T-Mobile, Sprint and all others fail. The buttons for texting and replying to emails are easy to handle. If you are looking for a ""phone"" this is the one to get. I would give this 10 starts if it were allowed. Another plus is it handles mp3's & GIF images which I upload from my own PC to the phone.",positive
"This phone is awesome. I have one through Boost Mobile with the unlimited plan. Bought it on August 6th and no regrets. People that whine and complain about the screen res or no games. It's a phone people, nothing more, nothing less. I use the walkie-talkie regularly, my wife and I text back and forth daily with no missed or missing messages. This phone receives/makes calls and walkie-talkie's where others have failed. If people want games buy a Gameboy, want pictures buy a camera, not real hard to figure out. This little gem was built to be a phone and that's exactly what it is. In short.... See it as it really is, a phone.",negative
"i dont want to sound like a hot head but i havent had the best luck with cell phones, when i get a bad call the phone goes flying. this phone has impressed me with its durablity, i have thrown it, droped it and it even went flying out of my cars window while on the street when i wasnt looking, and it still works. best phone i ever bought. why would you buy a phone that cost $400 and worry every time you drop it, when if this one falls you just brush off the dirt and go on your way.",negative
"I find texting impossible on this phone. As another reviewer said, the screen goes blank randomly and you have to turn it off and on again. Also the phone randomly turns off phone transmissions and you have to turn it back on to receive/make phone calls. There has to be better phones out there.",positive
"I recently had an i776 which was ruined at work. I had good service with it and it worked well. I spent $50 on this piece, the service is horrible, very patchy. I don't receive texts, sometimes the screens goes white for no reason. The key pad lights stopped working, the phone has no alarm. The battery doesn't last more than a day. I have only had to phone for two months. Its the worst phone ive owned, do not buy this. The i776 is a good phone,but you have to buy the rugged version.",negative
I LOVE THIS PHONE! YES I WOULD LOVE IT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE! THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT! I COULD BE DOING LAUNDRY AND BE TALKING IN SPEAKER AND HEAR AND BE HERD PERFECTLY WITHOUT THE ECKO MOST PHONES MAKE TO WHO EVER IS LISTENING TO YOU THE WEB IS NORMAL LIKE ANY OTHER PHONE THE TEXING IS GOOD ASS WELL OVERALL THIS PHONE WON ME OVER WITH ITS SOUND QUALITY IVE HAD SO MANY PHONES VERY LOW ON SOUND THIS PHONE IS PERFECT I HAD THE OTHER PHONE THE $[...]. ONE BUT UPGRADED TO THIS ONE AND LOVE IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE ITS VERY EASY TO TIPE THE BUTTONS ARE NOT HARD AT ALL LOVE THIS PHONE.,positive
"This phone is JUNK. Do NOT buy this phone. You will have much faster messaging via regular USPS. Your text messages will be lost in the vast time warp of boost mobilism where they will stay until you decide to try to use the internet on this phone. While waiting the regular 15 minutes for a webpage to load, you will be bumrushed by a million of delayed texts which will obliterate all the efforts this sorry little phone has put forth in trying to load the webpage. The screen will turn white and the entire phone will reset on its own. You will then have the responsibility of manually turning your transmitters back on for the phone to work again. If you are arguing with a girlfriend on this phone, she will dump you because she will think you have hung up on her. If you have close family members, they will abandon you and make pacts with other family members not to call or text you because you never text back and hardly ever answer. If you are having an affair with a married woman, this phone will hold all the messages you sent to her until her husband has come home. Then, like magic, this phone will deliver all the long lost messages as soon as he picks up his wife's phone. They should reaname this phone the i666. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this phone, but common sense makes one wonder if it wasn't created by a more sinister power. Possibly Satan himself.",negative
it withstands a lot and is worth the money only thing IT DOESNT HAVE A CAMERA,positive
"This was a replacement for the one my mom had that went south on us. Can't really complain about it because the problem with this device is the carrier not the phone. Probably should give it five stars because the seller gave a spot on description, gave a charger, and threw in a case for free but yet again my carrier doesn't seem to like the phone. I did receive this package next day.",positive
"The shipping time on the phone was great, The phone also works great and as it is supose to, My sims card had no problems as some stated theirs did, great battery life, nice looking phone. Work in a area that my other phone had no signal this phone does when clear out, Not so good when cloudy, But would buy again from seller. Thank you Mark",positive

"I got this phone because I wanted a phone that would have better reception than my previous phone. However, it never recognized any of the information stored on my SIM card, so it was essentially useless to me.",positive
"The phone was purchased through an 'Alpha Wireless' supposedly in Texas but shipped from a 'Go Green Wireless' out of Florida. While I understand that several companies may cooperate to fulfill orders it does make it difficult regarding recourse when, in this case, a phone was represented as 'New' and simply was not. The price paid should have more closely reflected the condition. Buyer beware as usual when using Amazon or Ebay.",positive
"It's a nice phone only if it worked properly. I can answer the phone but can't hear the person on the line I have to put the phone on speaker in order to hear, this causes people to hang up because the phone's a piece of junk. this started happen two days after I got the phone.....a bad choice.",negative
Very satisfied,positive
If you are looking for regular phone that's fairly durable this is great! Especially if used in heavy case? Yes I would recommend this phone,positive
The phone itself just has software problems. My signal was not constant. It would fluctuate anywhere and anytime. The screen is nice and the phone is a nice small size. I really like the candy bar phone but it just did not function well. Very frustrating. Bought in 2008.,positive
"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents).",negative
"The good news is that it has a long battery life and is lightweight. But none of that is worth anything if you cant hear the other person. I had a Samsung and a Sony before and never had this problem. The keypad is tough, requiring sledge hammer to push the keys. Bottom line: the phone is cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try Sony or Samsung, their cheapest models work better than this.",positive
"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics.",positive
"I love this phone. Retro early 2000s kind of phone. Light and handy size. Good battery life, good signal. You need to call Tracfone customer service though, for a new sim card and to help you activate the phone (buy a prepaid card first before you call) Great back up phone for people with a smartphone, or a main phone for people who have low phone usage, and just does a couple of text messages or a couple minute calls a day.",positive
The best phone I have used say 10 years back and when I saw a new one wanted to have it. You cant go wrong with this phone as a basic phone.,positive
Arrived a day early but SIM card registration failed and the unlock codes don't work. Consider returning it since it's defective.,negative
"I've had this phone for eons---at least 10 years, more like 12. My Nokia 1100 has been dropped many times where the back flies off and the battery flies out. It just keeps on working. No cracks or breaks. This thing has been dropped on cement more than once!! I just quit using it a week ago because I wasn't getting text messages sent from newer phones. It would come through as unreadable with the numbers 11001010 or something similar and I couldn't see who it was from either (if anyone knows how to remedy this, please tell me so I can go back to using this one!). This is my favorite phone. I also have a Samsung SGH-S425G and most recently added the Samsung Galaxy Stardust (all through Tracfone). The reason I like this Nokia 1100---I can text without ever looking at it because of the raised buttons. People with smart phones like to tell me that their phone has word prediction, which is when I get to tell them that this one does too! (Just gotta read the manual to see how to press the buttons once while spelling to get a list of suggested words). My smart phone takes me longer to do everything because it has too much stuff on it. With this one, I can make a call with 3 button presses, maybe 2. Not so on newer phones with more menus. If it weren't for needing to get text messages (work), I'd totally still be using this phone!!!!!",positive
"I have had my 1100b for several (>5) years and it was a cast off from my wife who used it for a couple of years before it became mine. I plan on keeping it until it becomes unusable. The phone is simple,no camera, monochrome display and some simple games. It is very sturdy and has exceptional battery life between charges. For more details see the wikipedea article on it. I do not use my phone very much so trac phone works well for me. To put it simply: a pay as you go set up like trac phone is good if you want to HAVE a cell phone but don't plan on USING it all the time. It is a cheap way to have one availible but could get expensive if you do not manange your minutes or if you use the phone alot like some people seem to do.",positive
"I'm still using one of these as my phone. It has great battery life, and works pretty much everywhere I go. The one exception is my sister's house, but then nobody's cell phone can seem to get a decent signal there. I don't text, so having something that is just a phone is perfect for me. It does have one special feature, there is an LED flashlight built into the top end of the case. That light has come in handy on a number of occasions. Personally I like the Tracfone service. I pay around $99 a year for the service and I've purchased the double-minute card so that I get twice the minutes. Minutes accumulate as you go. It's too bad they quit selling this model.",positive
"I used to have a Nokia 1100. They are simplistic, indestructible and have near infinite battery life. (I often charged it like once every other week!) They are primarily made for sale in developing countries. As for Tracfone, I have no idea.",positive
"came with no sim card not in the box like the picture, don't waste your time with this",positive
"I bought this solely to use as an intermediary transition step for porting my land line phone number over to Google Voice. It worked great, and the LPN had my landline number on this phone for only about four hours, so very good service. Only problem was when I went to port the second number, apparently I couldn't do it with the same SIM because the account had already been activated, then deactivated post-porting to Google Voice. However, Tracfone customer service (foreign call center), after troubleshooting on another phone call with me for 45 minutes finally agreed to send me a new SIM card (took 9 days to receive) and then I could activate again and port the 2nd number. The second time, I decided to give the phone to my son after porting, and called customer service and this time they were able to re-activate on the same 2nd SIM that had just finished the same procedure the first SIM did. Odd, but it worked!",positive
"I dropped my Samsung 301g and cracked the screen. I ordered a new one from Amazon and after activating it and having my minutes transferred by Tracfone, the web browser would not work. 2 Days of calls to customer service resulted in still no browser. They said that the browser would not connect to the tower. The customer service lady was, as were the ones before her, very polite and extremely courteous to me. This last rep just told me, without me asking her, to wait for a new phone to be sent to me in 3-5 days. Then I will call to get my number and minutes transferred again. I had no problems with the last phone that this one replaced and expect the same for the replacement. All worked great except the lack of a browser. I don't use the browser but need it to download new ring tones.",positive
"I LUV this Fone :)) !! Being disabled and having use of only 1 hand, the fact that this cell has the extended keyboard makes my fone easier to grab either from a table or my handbag! I've used my fone @ least 50 x's and have NOT hit the browser button once, however I did follow Angela G's code advice and it worked :) yay! I continue to purchase Samsung products for myself and others...TOP-RATED in my opinion plus great value! I've had Tracfone for years with 1 call that was promptly answered and settled as quick! I saved 60% off and as a new Amazon Prime buyer I received my fone in 2 days so an AWESOME buy for me!!!!",positive
"After toting around a smartphone for a few years I decided that I needed a backup. I purchased this as a ""just in case"" - and it's become my primary phone. I don't surf the web on my phone. I use it to make and receive telephone calls. It does this wonderfully and is so light that I forget that it's in my pocket. Did I mention that I only have to charge it twice a week?",positive
"This is a pretty neat cheap phone. It activates easy and came with 20 minutes free! I thought that was pretty sick. And it has double minutes for life, so whenever you add more, you get double what you paid for for free. Pretty sick! I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs a cheap little prepaid for any reason.",positive
"I have had a couple of these phones for years. I had one and my husband had one. My husband's finally died after about 2 years so I wanted to replace it with one like we had. It worked right out of the box and we are happy with it. It is a no frills phone, but it does what we want it to do. I would recommend this product. The price is great, too!",positive
"I'm not in the US much, but when I'm there it's nice to have a phone to use. This phone works fine, just don't open any messages unless you know who it's from ... every time I opened a message it took a minute off my time and the messages were just spam.",positive
"This was a replacement for the exact phone that was run over by a golf cart. TracFone was awesome to transfer all my minutes from my old phone to this one..(and they were not required to do so). To my surprise, I got a phone that has double minutes for life on top of it!",positive
"I wasn't expecting much for the price but this is actually a pretty cool phone!. My elderly aunt uses it specially because she can see the big numbers she is dialing. It's pretty light, portable and we love the flip in-out motion. Tracfone plans are not the cheapest BUT they do have awesome coverage everywhere. While I was having problems dialing a call with my own phone in a pretty remote area, I realized that I had only one bar on my cell, and my aunt had 5 bars on her Samsung/Tracfone! Kudos. Great product.",positive
"This phone is pretty nice. It would've gone arrived in two days but Amazon decided to ship w/ USPS so I just got the phone yesterday. I mean it's not an Android, but it has a camera and you can play your music on it. At a time when I'm trying to reduce expenses this phone does the job just fine.",positive

I feel this phone has met my expectations. It's for my 9yo son. It's easy to use & a good first phone for him. I especially like the GPS feature on this for a Lost child/person. I purchased this for safety & I would & have recommended this to other parents for their children.,positive
"This phone is good except for the bluetooth. There is no way to place the phone into discoverable mode. Therefore, no other bluetooth devices can see it!",positive

"I ordered the phone because it is the same model as one that I had that stopped working. When I got it, I found out that I could not unlock the phone and it was therefore useless to me so I returned it.

I recommend T-Mobile's prepay plan.",negative
"My wife and I each have one of this model Tracfone. Neither has been a problem with outgoing or incoming calls. No dropped calls. Voice quality has been clear and natural sounding. We haven't yet found any areas where the phone won't work, and this covers New England to Oregon. Those are the ""pros."" The following are the ""cons,"" along with some physical features we would like to see improved: - One of my biggest cons is the fact that the browser key is fixed and cannot be changed or disabled. The prompt that gets you into this limited browser can be easily activated and cost you fractions of minutes. - I carry my T301G sideways in a belt holder. I have occasionally missed a call when extracting the phone and quickly pressing the ""off"" button by mistake. This won't shut the phone off, but it will cancel the incoming call. - The little, raised line under the display is used to slide the phone open. This line is too small and and just about useless to use. A rubber, or ribbed area on the side of the phone would be much more useful to slide the phone up. I find the process to be a ""two thumbs"" operation if you don't want to press on the LED display all the time - or activate one of the soft keys which are much too close. - My previous Tracfone was a ""clamshell"" V176. This has a rubber feel to the phone, and I never thought I might drop the thing because of a slick, or slippery exterior. I wish the T301G was made from the same material - although I have not yet dropped this phone. - The four soft keys can be programmed for whatever you want. I have found that assigning your ""contact list,"" messages, list of incoming calls and phone info (minutes and time left) works best for me. The keys themselves, however, are still too small. The ""incoming calls"" one is needed for when I mistakenly disconnect a call as mentioned above. - I found the phone information that constantly scrolls across the screen to be distracting and irritating. I was able to shut this function off through the menu though. The press of one of the soft keys now tells me this information. The above ""cons"" are not a deal breaker for me. Life with this phone would be just a little easier if they were addressed. Some other thoughts: - I have never had trouble adding minutes to either phone. I do it over the internet. All they want is your phone number (as long as the phone is registered with Tracfone - easy to do). You purchase the minutes/time and they appear on the phone almost immediately. Keep the phone ""on"" while doing this. - My V176 lasted almost six years with no problems until the last two weeks of it's life. If I can get this same performance from the T301G, then (for the price)I think it will be worth it. - I know it would make the phone a bit larger, but I wish the soft keys, menu and browser keys, and key pad itself were a little larger. Less room for error and more comfortable to use. - I have the phone set to answer (or call) when the slide is used. I don't think the browser will activate, by accident, when the phone is closed, because it's locked then. (Edit on the above - If the phone is ""on,"" then the browser will activate even when the phone closed (locked). This ""con"" continues to grow larger) Not a great camera, but it will do in a pinch. The volume control is on the side of the phone. Ascending from 1 thru 7. One press below 1 puts the phone on vibrate. Easy. All-in-all, this is a nice little phone, for the price, and the fact that no contracts are involved. Much less expensive to operate than than most any other phone. It would, (at least for me) be the perfect little phone if the above ""cons"" could be ironed out. __________________________________ March, 2014 -I have to add these thoughts to the above review. It's been just about four years since I wrote the above comments. The necessity of opening the phone by placing a thumb on the screen has not been a problem at all. The rugged little screen is no worse for the constant manipulation. My wife and I were up in mid-Maine last May. I had my new Apple iPhone with me. Three of the others I was with had iPhones and one android phone. It was necessary to call a person at the local historical society. These four ""high end"" phones got ""no service"" in this remote area. I remembered that I had the Tracfone in the glove compartment, because I still had a couple of months of time left on the phone. Yes - you guessed it - the Samsung T301G made this call just fine. No, the T301G doesn't take really clear photos and it's difficult to send a text or record appointments. But, it was the only device (out of five) that actually made a telephone call! You know I put another year on the T301G and have it with me when I need to travel to these out-of-the-way places. I can now add ""dependable"" to the list of positive comments above. I don't know why the Tracfone was the only one able to make the important call - I just know that it did. The above ""cons"" are still valid, but have not been the problem I anticipated when writing the initial post. This phone is a gem.",positive
"Just had to add my two cents. I read the reviews about the ease of accidentally hitting the browser button and losing minutes, and I ordered this phone anyway. And I agree 100% about the browser. While setting up the phone I have lost a few minutes already by accidentally hitting the darn browser key. What a dumb place to put a browser key! (It's the top right button on the front of the phone, and if you bump it, hit it, press it accidentally (even when the phone is in the closed position), if your phone is on, you will lose 0.5 minutes. I have searched all over the web and there is no way to disable it, or at least have it ask you if you want to connect. Terrible terrible feature. I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and entered *#4777*8665# and followed the instructions, and it doesn't work for me, and from other sites I have found out, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am going to see over the next month how much time I lose, and then I may have to take another reviewer's advice from another website and glue the button shut. (He said this worked for him fine and you can still get to the browser from the menu button). I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who has kids, your kids will drain their minutes by accident.",negative
"I purchased mine at a K-mart about a year ago. I fell in love with it and added some games to it by using credits (minutes) I had accumulated. The features are great and even though the internet access was a bit shaky and slow, that didn't matter to me since I didn't use it much for that purpose anyway. The coolest thing about this phone is I was helping my brother pull his boat up next to a dock and the phone slipped out of my pocket and into the water. Even though I only paid twenty bucks for it, new, I also had some 300 minutes on it and also some pictures I took, so I was dissapointed I would lose them both. I just looked at the phone sitting there on the sand, and even though I knew there wasn't much chance for it, I stretched my hand down as far as I could and retrieved the phone. The window lit up when I shook the water from it. My brother said I would have to take it apart right away and dry everything as quickly as possible. I wasn't sure how to take it apart, and didn't have any tools, but it was still working, so I figured it might be okay. Later the screen wouldn't come on, and I thought it was done. An hour or two later, the screen began to work again, but the key pad wouldn't work. A couple of hours later, the keypad began working again, and everything was fine. It has been fine ever since and that was over a week ago. The only thing I don't like is that the only way to retreive the pictures is to send them via e-mail to the computer. It does offer double minutes, so I figure it is still worth it. Now I get a kick out of using it knowing it laid on the sand under two feet of water and still works great.",positive
"UPDATE: December 8, 2011 In the past year, I have gone through 3 of these phones. Based on that, the Samsung T301G has got to be one of the worst phones ever made. The main problem is that when the phone breaks, Tracfone sends out a REFURBISHED one. The refurbs were probably returned for the same reason as I returned my first phone (it was freezing and finally became unresponsive). After I called to ask that they send me a new phone, they said OK but they again sent a used one. I'm only going to activate it because most of their other phones have also gotten bad reviews. I picked this Tracfone after my Motorola broke after 2 years of use. This phone has very, very short batter life (needs to be charged every other day even if it hasn't been used very much) and it's Bluetooth function does NOT work with my Bluetooth enabled GPS and other devices for hands-free calling. The only positive is that the phone looks better than the Motorola and that it's faster at sending/receiving text messages, even though the controls and buttons to type the text are very small and hard to get used to. To sum it all up, if you can, please buy a different phone and save yourself the headache of having a broken phone every 3 months (and that's in the case of a NEW one. Used/Refurbished ones are broken OUT OF THE BOX). Tracfone used to be good, but with this, one of the worst phones ever made, and the fact that they keep sending me a used one makes them one of the most annoying companies I've had to deal with.",negative
I spent time today looking for a new phone. All I see is heartbleed issues and battery eaters. I have used this phone since they came out with it. I never have battery problems. I have played Sudoku till my eyes hurt. It takes pretty nice pictures. It has a voice recorder that I even forget to use. The alarm clock is great. The bluetooth never worked. I dropped it once in Walmart and the headphone and USB cable never worked after that. But it does make calls and receive calls like it should. I used the browser occasionally. I don't think the browser works anymore. I can still email photos to my email. I think it is time for a new phone. The amazing thing is I found it in my purse lining. I traveled this week and couldn't find my phone. I thought it was lost forever. It kept sending out a low battery signal and I could hear where it was. I had a hole in my purse lining and the phone had slipped into the lining. The battery life is still amazing. Not sure what to do with a phone that really is a phone.,positive
"This phone is darn good EXCEPT, the browser is tied to the back button. So if you press the back button too many times, $.50 gets deducted when the browser is activated. No warnings of money to be taken. Unbelievable design flaw. Or maybe a scam by design. Otherwise, for the $30 I paid, its very good. I'm returning it now. No more samsung for me. FOLLOW-UP 1/25/2011: Apparently this flaw which prevents me from NOT getting this phone is NOT samsungs fault. I ordered a different replacement phone from TracFone/Net10 (same co.) and it does the same thing. They are programming these phones to do this. The manual says the key is attached to the contact list where the TracFone/Net10 version is attached to the Web and not re-programmable. So its not the phone. Sorry about that. It is a good phone otherwise but not with the Tracfone/Net10 folks. I left it at one star so folks can read the caveat if they use it with Tracfone/Net10.",positive
"I have another Tracfone (a simple Motorola flip) that I love. If it were still available I would have purchased it. I'm not a heavy cell phone user so prepaids are great for me. Why a got a second phone is a long, boring story. The bottom line is when this Samsung is immediately next to my Motorola in my home, it has sometimes has only 2 bars while my Motorola has four. I've had it in areas where there is generally excellent cell coverage where it has no reception/signal at all while my Motorola (again, immediately next to the Samsung) has four bars and is working fine. I have gotten nowhere near the standby battery life that is cited on Tracfone's product description. Most of my conversations are in the 1-3 minute range. Most days I make fewer than three calls. I can't imagine how short the battery life would be if I actually used it to talk for any period of time. Even fully charged at the beginning of the day the battery shows as low by the end of the day or the next AM. While there are some nice features (being able to assign ring tones to contacts) that my older phone doesn't have, those features are worthless if I can't make calls or the battery is dead or dying.",positive
"This phone is OK. The one thing that is really bad about this phone though is that if someone texts you, something will pop up on the screen that says ""1 new message"" and the time and date that the message was sent, that's good but it doesn't say who the message is from until you view the message. So sometimes it doesn't matter if it shows you who it's from or not, but a lot of times it does because after you open the message, minutes get deducted, so you could open a text from someone you don't know or open a text that you don't want to respond to, and you won't know who it's from until after your minutes get deducted. I have wasted a lot of minutes because of that. Although, when someone calls you it DOES say who the call is from. I am planning on getting a new phone that shows who your text messages are from. -Jill, Age 12",negative
"Others have mentioned the same problems I have with the Samsung T301G: must recharge at least every 3 days and browser key is too easy to hit accidentally. Photos grainy and that I know of, no way to download onto a computer. Yes, sometimes locks up randomly in spite of using the menu to leave it unlocked. (Can unlock by entering code 1234.) In addition, even with the loudest ring tone I can find, I can't hear it ring unless I'm in a totally quiet room--though I have no difficulty hearing my Motorola 370. Most annoying perhaps, is the fact that once you reach the name & number you want on the contact menu, you still to scroll through more options to reach ""Call"", instead of being able to just press the green button to ""Send"". And why in the world is ""Call"" not option #1 instead of #4? It's an unnecessary step. Sending a text could be simplified. Having said all of that, sound quality and volume levels are excellent when making calls. It also has an excellent system of options for being able to view and delete information for missed calls and messages. Tracfone itself? In 7 years with them, while it sometimes requires a wait (like most companies!), once you get through, they're usually able to solve the problem pretty quickly. And when my daughter hits a dead area with her AT&T phone, I hand her my Tracfone and she makes her call. (We live in Oregon, Portland area.)",positive
Very light in weight. (my 7 yr old can slap it in half easily) Voice is crisp and clear while talking. The speaker phone is clear but needs to be on the highest setting. The browser button is badly located. Accidentally press it couple of times. You cannot change the menu. (Menu and Browser) You can change the shortcut buttons. Fingerprints on screen of course. Easily slide opened. Limited access to the web. Tracfone locked some of its feature I believe. You cannot email of Google. It is great standard phone for making calls only.,negative
"I replaced my Motorola w376g, with this model, as I can't get the w376g in my area anymore. I'm disappointed with the T301G. * It reception isn't as good as the motorola's. * The battery lasts only 3 days on standby * The keypad is recessed making it awkward, its taking me quite a while to get used to it * Reception comes and goes even when its strong * The camera takes grainy photos There are only a couple of things I like about the phone: * The phone's default setting has the key lock on, especially convenient because the web browser button is on the outside * Its fairly small, only a tad larger than my motorola * Good voice quality After reading all these good reviews, I wonder if I got a dud. //Edit Oct 20 I exchanged this one for another of the same model. The reception was even worse than the first one.",negative
"Tracfone still has the best geographic coverage of the pay as you go cell phone options. I had tried a Common Cents option when I wanted to upgrade to a phone with Bluetooth capabilities to work with a newly acquired car and bought in to the Common Cents hype about lower per minute cost and the round down on partial minutes of airtime. What Common Cents does not emphasize in their advertising is that there is absolutely no roaming. If you are outside of the Sprint network coverage area the phone will not work. Just because you have a friend or acquaintance with a Sprint Contract phone that gets coverage in the areas that you travel does not ensure that a Common Cents phone will work in those areas. I subsequently upgraded my Tracfone to the Samsung t301g which did pair with my Ford Sync system and allows hand free calling. I was unable to get the contact list from the phone uploaded to the Sync system but Ford does have some free downloadable software that allows you to create a contact list on your computer and then transfer it to the vehicle via a USB data key. The phone documentation is minimal and the download available from TracFone adds very little information. The default ringtone is progressive, starts out soft and gets louder, and I doubt that anyone will hear the first two rings in a store, restaurant or car. There are several other ringtones built in and I found one that was satisfactory when the volume is adjusted upward. The call volume is also adjustable during a call and most people will probably need to set it near the maximum for use with the hands free calling options with Ford Sync. One peculiarity of the phone is that there is no provision for setting the date and time manually and the time picked up from the network is about two minutes slow. I initiated a support request via email and one week, four emails and about 2 hours spent on the phone with three ""customer support"" representatives I finally received an email confirming that there was no way to manually adjust the time, that they could do nothing about the incorrect (Compared to NIST)time, and stating that the ""issue had been addressed"", which in my opinion is not the same as the issue being resolved. While the ""Customer Support"" representative were courteous, they speak a dialect that is difficult to understand and one every call you spend at least five minutes repeating information that you provided in you initial support request and all of your previous calls and then long periods on hold as they ""check with a supervisor"" or search ""their system"" for additional information regarding your problem. In summary the phone is usable and does provide some functionality with Ford Sync systems at a reasonable price when you factor in that you get double minutes for the life of the phone. TracFone support is basically non-existent. If you are the type that reads manuals and are willing to do some internet research Tracfone provides ""as needed airtime"" at a reasonable cost. If you are the type that likes or needs some hand holding you should probably look elsewhere and if you have become dependent on a cell phone to provide the correct time you definitely need a different phone.",positive
"I ordered 2 of these phones for use as TracFones. Both of them had to have the SIM card replaced. One still didn't work after the card was put in place, so it took numerous customer service calls to get it going. Both phones have no voice mail features. Whenever I try to access the voice mail option, the phone won't allow me to enter. I had to place more calls to customer service and have yet to have this problem resolved. It's been nearly 3 weeks now! How much of this is the phone and how much is the service, I can't say. But since the phone is a TracFone exclusive, it all seems to tie together.",negative
"it looks cool, feel good, but the menu screen is kinda questionable. hard to tell what youre doing in the menu if youre not used to it. also, it subracts .6 minutes a message when my last one only subracted .3 minutes... also, the service is questionable. i wouldn't buy this phone if you live out in the country where service is patcher...exactly where i live -.-",positive

"If you live in an area where there is any question about cell phone service....then read on before you buy a Tracfone on-line. You cannot return a phone using Tracfone on-line, you have to call them to get an RA# and then they tell you to call them to provide the Tracking number. Let me clarify....I bought my Tracfone directly...not through Amazon, so this is in no way a reflection on Amazon. Here is what it took to get RA #...4 calls/over 2 days. 2 calls were dropped by Tracfone due to volume. I waited 20 minutes on the 3rd, without reaching an agent (I had to drop). 4th call I waited 15 minutes to get an agent. Then it took another 30 minutes for them to ask all the questions. First, why I was returning the phone {phone was fine...service was 2 bars or less at home]. Then, I had to give them all my contact information (which should have popped up, because I gave them my order number). After all this effort I gasped when they told me that I had to call them with the return tracking number to ensure I got my refund. I thought that they were being nice when they gave me an unpublished number to call. Silly me, I am on my 6th dropped call due to high volume....still have not been able to get through on either line. It has been another two days of trying. Tracfone customer support is pitiful!",positive

"Maybe I'll figure it out in the future and update this post accordingly to reflect some new revelation. At this current time though, I am quite confused as to how one can still accidentally hit the browser button months after getting the phone. I can understand accidentally hitting it until you stop doing so due to a learned response; ""Fire is hot, and burns, causing pain. Don't touch the fire."" It's as if people are making some conspiracy out of this button. Samsung sells a ton of Galaxy smartphones for hundreds of dollars to millions of people. I don't think the literal 2 dollars a month you might waste due to this button is going to affect their bottom line. Don't get me wrong, I like a good conspiracy but I'm not seeing it here.",negative
"I did not get much use out of this phone. In fact I haven't used it at all. To understand what I'm saying first you must get the explanation on why I purchased this phone. My younger brother had a tracfone and he lost the battery. How he managed to do that? Well I have no idea. Anyway the reason this phone was purchased was so he could just switch his sim card into it and move on with his life and my mother had recently purchased a year's worth of service on his original phone. Unfortunately Tracfone will not allow you to switch sim cards into a new phone, even though these both use the exact same model card. They will however make exceptions if you call in and talk to a representative in person.",negative
"I carry this phone with me daily. It's a decent phone. I don't particularly like it because I have to be outside to get a strong signal, I get a fair signal in the car. Less than fair at home, and no signal at work, in a store, school, or hospital. But, it is mainly for when I am out and about. Or emergency. I just hope I don't have to rely on it for an emergency at work. However. It was very inexpensive. Down right cheap. So, I guess you get what you pay for.",positive

"A few comments on this phone: 1) The builtin ringtones are lame, they're uninspiring, almost random sounding ""tunes,"" however I find the ring volume loud enough, in contrast to complaints from some users that it's too low. Perhaps Samsung fixed this issue. 2) The screen is 2"" diagonal, which is a good size for a low end phone, however the low resolution makes it a bit grainy. Also it has a narrow viewing angle, i.e. you have to hold it at a certain angle or it appears dark or washed out. 3) The mobile web capability is very limited because of the phone's low memory. Originally Tracfone only allowed you to go to a set of preselected sites. Now you can enter any URL, but most of the time you get an insufficent memory error because the site is too large. I mainly use it to get info. by searching Google, in lieu of the Google SMS service that they discontinued. 4) As others have noted, when you close the slider the outer buttons don't lock immediately, you have to wait a few seconds before putting it in your pocket, otherwise the browser button could get pushed and you can lose a lot of minutes. 5) Battery standby time is less than a week, which is lower than other phones I've used. On the other hand it recharges faster than usual. EDIT: I recently charged the phone on a Sunday night, and it lasted until the next Monday morning, with light usage during the week. It will stay at one battery bar for a while and still be functional. When you recharge it, there doesn't seem to be any alert when it is finished, you have to just see if the battery icon is full. 6) The menu screens have a black and orange color scheme which, while readable, is a bit odd. I got it when it was $8, from Dealathon, and I'm still using it. Overall I'd say it is worth the current price of $5, for those of us who are not into the complexity and cost of smartphones. You can upgrade to another Tracfone later on. You can connect it to your Windows PC using a free program from Samsung and a cable you can get from Amazon for a few dollars, see this thread on the Howard forum: [...] ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unlike some of their other phones, Samsung doesn't provide a PDF booklet/manual for this phone. However, the Samsung T245G flip phone has features that are mostly similar and that does have a manual at [...] The main menus of the two phones are the same except for item #6, which on the T301G is ""Games & Apps"" while on the T245G it is ""Camera."" In actuality, the ""Games & Apps"" item on the T301G contains Games and the Camera function, so that item is not properly named. While the T245G doesn't have games, just the Camera function.",negative
"Does the job. Nothing fancy but provides a cheap, adequate cell phone for someone that just wants to use it for emergencies and when there is no other option available. However, it is fragile.

"You may turn off GPRS (mobile web/MMS) to save battery life if you do not use GPRS features. However, the option requires accessing a secret menu. This is how: Open the slider and type *#4777*8665# and a menu should pop up. Go to menu number 5, Attach Mode. Select Manual attach. OK. It will inform you that you need to restart the phone for this to take effect - do this later. Then go to menu number 2, GPRS detach. The phone will notify you that it has done the GPRS detach, which means that it is no longer connected to the GPRS network. Now restart the phone, and there should be a blue and white G at the top of the screen instead of a red and white one. Success! Of course, you may reverse this at any time by going back to the secret menu and selecting Auto attach and GPRS attach. This will NOT adversely affect your ability to add minutes to the phone via [...] or by using a minutes card purchased in a store.

"This is a really good phone if you just need a basic model for low use, or just to keep for emergencies. I've had the big phone contracts, but now, I do not need that and I cannot justify paying that bill every month for a phone that I rarely use. I previously had a samsung katalyst and before that a samsung flip phone, I love the samsung phones they are really good quality and stand up to a decent amount of abuse. This particular phone is a cheaper model, but is similar to the Katalyst that I just finished up with. So far it's been good, sound quality is good. I also want to touch on tracphone's customer service. I had to call them because the minutes I placed on my phone didn't show up on the phone after several attempts to retrieve them, Customer service was excellent! They walked be through what to do and problem solved, they were very polite and curtious as well, all around a great experience.

"My minutes just would evaporate on this phone. One day I would have 100 minutes and pick up the phone out of my purse and it would have 80. Then 80 to 60, then 60 to 30 and I had not made a call. Didn't know why, still don't know why unless like the other reviewers said the browser was accidentally being turned on. Tracfone replaced it first saying the phone was defective, but the new one is doing the same thing. MINUTES DISAPPEAR. When I complained was told several times by the first two women that the phone was working properly and they did their best to dismiss me. So, I asked if they were calling me a liar. Finally they decided to send me a new, different brand of phone. What irks me about this entire situation is, you KNOW they KNEW what was happening to me, yet feigned ignorance. After I told them I had been a faithful tracfone user for eight years and did not have this problem with my other phone, did their attitude change a bit. Still very upset the way they treated me, but it is typical of the way companies treat their customers these days. AT&T is worse, much worse. If I had a choice I would change. In fact, I felt like just giving up all this technology and doing without a cell phone. How much do we have to pay to be treated like garbage? Tracfone you are the pits today. It's terrible to waste so much time talking to these people, even if in the end they do what is right. I know I was on the phone way over an hour. They knew all along what it was, and kept denying there was a problem. My blood pressure I am sure was skyrocketing.",negative
"You can read on an unopened package what features a phone has but what people really need to hear is how those features you use most ""work."" It's a well built phone that I will use mostly for talking and limited texting. My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing). Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down! Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction. The 376 has a ""flimsy"" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily. The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear. Samsung produced some features you don't see in the average ""prepay plan phones."" The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors). They'll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.",positive
"As some of you have discovered these phones, along with many others, have a habit of accidentally dialing the browser when you place the phone in your holster and eating up lots of minutes. The simple fix is to wait about five seconds for the screen to go blank before placing the phone in the holster. This locks the keys until you press unlock then OK or slide the phone open. The browser will not dial if you wait these few seconds. It's a pain and stupid on Samsung's part but it's the only way to prevent this problem, there's no way to lock out the browser.",negative
"I found Tracfone coverage in AC 508 spotty at best, non-existent in most towns on MVY. ""Customer Service"" (as many other reviewers point out) is a joke, the operators are not only unwilling but also incapable of giving any kind of explanation why the service varies so greatly within a few hundred feet, also depending on the time of day. You may find yourself in a ""black hole"". The little Samsung works OK, the display is bright and the buttons not too responsive (except the cursed browser one). Volume control is not quite up to par. The menu to access functions is unncessarily complicated and not at all intuitive.",positive
"Read other reviews for pros/cons, but do note that the dual use charger-headset jack is not micro or mini USB. According to Samsung and a local dealer, there is no adapter available. None of the multiple adapters provided with the phone will work w/the proprietary jack. So, you cannot use your own plug-in headset or a universal external extended battery, and there are no OEM extended batteries w/cover. I was told by a dealer that post 2008 phones must have compatible micro or mini jacks, and T301g is older. If this is not an issue for you, the phone is a very good simple phone, especially once the browser is disabled. These are problems for me, and may be for you: 1. microphone quality of provided headset is significantly lower than the Plantronics I was using; 2. I am in a rural area and the battery use is higher than the previous Motorola tracfone, so other battery options are helpful; 3. bluetooth costs more than the phone, and given phone and battery life, didn't seem a worthwhile investment.",negative
"When I first tried out tracfone, I bought this phone. I got it on sale for $19.99 and it had double minutes for life. It worked so well, I got it for myself, then my wife saw it and wanted one for her. I find the battery life is actually pretty good as is the reception. This is a great little phone! UPDATE: 4-6-14: My wife wanted to go back to a Basic phone. She said she wanted a tracfone that was a flip phone, however, when she remembered that we had these from years ago, she opted to return to this Model. Great little phone!",positive
"The Samsung T301G Tracfone has many more features than stated. From a very adjustable camera. To the ability to record your own ring tone. Sending & receiving email, up to 640 x 480 graphics. The ONLY detraction is the sound quality of it's transmitted signal. (You might sound tinny to the people you call when the battery gets low.) Overall though, I give this phone high marks. You won't get a better phone at anywhere near this price.",negative
"I've used mine for several years and overall have been pleased. Don't use it much. But I have tried it in California, Florida, and the midwest and never had a dropped call. Biggest complaint is it sometimes will turn on by itself and use up power. Note that there is no card to store pictures. The best way to transfer photos from the phone is to connect it to your computer, and copy them.",positive
"Exactly the kind of mobile phone I need as a back-up emergency phone. Easy to activate online & easy to use. If you're looking for a basic phone with some nice added features, this one could be for you. I've had Samsung mobile phones in the past and have been pleased with the quality.",positive
"I was a Tracfone customer for years and have to say that this was one of the worst Tracfones that I owned. PROS: 1) Cool design 2) Easy to use interface CONS: 1) Quiet ringers 2) Phone got a terrible signal 3) Hard to hold onto- the shape of the phone is not hand friendly 4) Terrible voice quality and tons of dropped calls 5) Phone often slid open on its own After I bought this phone I was sorry that I switched from the LG 600G phone, which is easily the best Tracfone being offered.",negative
"I like this phone ""OK"". I've have simple needs and this phone works well, but I have to subtract a couple of stars because of that darn browser button that I have hit several times by accident, costing me 1/2 unit of airtime each time. It screams of a ""SCAM"" to reduce your airtime/units, and there seems to be no way to fix this issue. I also have some concern as to how durable the phone would be, should I drop it when it's not in the case I bought for it off eBay. Finally, the screen is difficult to read in sunlight. But other than these things, the phone seems to suit my needs well enough, and saves me a lot of money versus an overpriced ""gotcha"" contract plan.",negative
"The browser button is on the face of this flip phone. It often gets triggered when you try to answer a call or when you put the phone in your pocket. You get charged a minimum of 1/2 minute whenever this happens. I never use my browser, but TracPhone can not disable internet service for your handset, nor will they reimburse you for accidental triggering of this button. :(",negative
A good backup phone that can be maintained at a very low cost.,positive
"My phone had excellent reception in metro Detroit area. Fair camera quality. Bluetooth headset sync was easy. Have to pay TracFon 4min. to transfer photos :( because Bluetooth and x-fer cable is disabled. Some photos took 2 attempts (8 minutes!). Purchased the phone from my local Target, but Tracfon had to send a new SIM card to activate it. Phone started to die after 6 months; often can't turn it off. When it is off, you can see the keypad flash like it is trying to turn on. Drains the battery over night. Might go away after charging, but full or low battery does not effect problem. Tracfon will not let me just swap the SIM card to a new phone, so all the contact info will be lost :( I expected better.",positive
"So long as you don't require customer service, tracfone is fine. But if you do, expect a foretaste of hell. I really appreciate it when I say something to a rep and they proceed as if I had never said anything. And if for any reason you deserve a refund, well, say your prayers but don't expect them to be answered. I switched to another company.",positive
it's ok did not used it,positive
"This is an excellent Samsung prepaid phone. Organizes well, high quality, and perfectly priced. You really can't beat it. It's very easy to use too. The Tracfone service offers everything - from big savings each month to awesome coast to coast coverage nationwide. It has everything you need in a cell phone, but without a monthly overcharged cell phone bill. Def reccommend this phone and service to anyone looking for a great deal.",positive
Left for vacation and my LG600g phone was in the console. At 2am thought it was safe when valet parked it. GONE. Bought this phone because it had bluetooth and a couple other features the 600 didn't. BEWARE! Bluetooth will not connect to your computer for file transfer. Only for headset. Buttons hard to use. 2 steps to unlock slider. Called Tracfone Indian CS AND THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME THE MINUTES PROMISED FROM THE 600. No answer from Emails. Returning this phone. Calling CS again shortly.,positive
"Besides being a very good phone, this Samsung phone is Bluetooth enabled, has a nice camera, and the slider is easy to use. Loaded with good features but not complicated to use.",positive
"I was very disappointed in this phone. Despite Tracfone telling me it was good in my area it did not tell me that web access or multimedia support does not work in my area. I can't send a picture, browse the web or send email. I went to tracfone to download ringtones on my computer and the download failed, but I was still charged for the ringtone. Trying to get technical support I was only allowed to buy new airtime. Phone support personnel do not have any good english speaking skills. The three calls to tech support sounded like they were in a concert hall and they could not resolve my issues. Tracfone is fine for $20 phone and text service and a 3 month card for $20-40, but using tracfone with this phone is a disappointment and I don't recommend it unless you know that web & multimedia support is available in your area.",negative
"Battery life is too short (cheap battery). Even if you do not use the phone and simply leave it ON, you will need to recharge it every 3 days. Indoor reception is poor. The phone does not work in Canada when vacationing. I will probably replace this phone after 1 year.",negative
"3 people in my family have this HORRID phone! This phone will randomly LOCK itself up. You power off one day...then BOOM. You try to turn the phone back on, and it is 'locked'. It will have a space for you to enter a passcode. GOOD LUCK guessing what it is! Customer Service at Tracfone said: "" buy a new phone"" (a.k.a. TRASH this one) ""...and we will switch your service over to it."" TRASH. GARBAGE. Stay away from this one, folks. I searched online, and it seems this is a pretty common thing for this phone. No answers for fixing this problem. TRACFONE says replacing the phone is the only option. Wish I had read THIS (or one like it) review first. Live and learn.",positive
"i like everything about the phone except it's reception - i live in an area without great reception, but my old phone worked fine. the new one only rings 1 time in 4 :(",positive
"They don't make them like this anymore, that should make you appreciate what you go. Although the one I received used did have a minor defect.",negative
Problem: phone was phased out by AT&T so i couldn't even use it or buy sim card or anything for it! AT&T should inform sellers!!,negative
This is the third phone I've purchased for my son since we switched him to AT&T. The first two were the same phone and were no good within a few months. This one has lasted him almost a year now. He likes it and I like not having to replace it all the time.,positive
"thank you so much, and thanks for everything, i need, i want, i love it, its excellent, wonderful, forever thanks",positive
It's doing good but I was expecting a charger to come with it. I had to get one to fit the phone,positive
It's exactly what I was looking for. Nice and simple. I would recommend this to anyone looking for less technical.,positive
Brand new - out of the box - I charged this phone as instructed (four hours - I gave it six) and when unplugged - black screen. I am returning to Amazon.,negative

"Phone came and is okay, but phone was never cleared and had all previous owners information and numbers in it. Not cool.",negative
"We were looking for an attractive, pre-paid cell phone and this fit the bill. It's easy to use, has good battery life, and includes a serviceable camera. The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward. Call quality with AT&T is very good. There are two things that could be improved: there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC. For the price though it's no big deal. Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone.",positive
"If you are looking for something simple that has great call quality this is the phone. I researched low SAR (absorbed radiation) and this was the cheapest most simple phone available. My other phone was ancient, so this feels like a huge step up. Love the speakerphone, internal antenna. The camera doesn't take super clear pictures, but my other phone didn't have a camera at all - so still a step up. Overall pleased with how it functions and quality of calls.",positive
"HIGHS- good sound quality, good reception, and decent battery life LOWS- VERY small cheap feeling plastic buttons, confusing menu, no flash",positive
I saw this phone at Best Buy for the same price but with $30 included air time,positive

"I was told on the phone, by Amazon customer support, that this phone had Bluetooth capability. The Amazon website even shows you bluetooth headsets as ""available accessories"". However, this phone doe not support either bluetooth or wireless headsets. I guess that is why it is so cheap. I had to return the phone. Inside the packaging, Samsung had a picture of a ""corded"" headset you could purchase for this phone.",positive
we havent got the phone yet but id say my dad will love it cause he has been lookin for one like it,positive
"A friend was using one of these phones, then gave it me about 6 months ago. A few days back, I just switched my sim card and went online to at&t change the ""make"" of my phone, this phone wasn't available in the list. But it works just fine, only been using it for a few days, long battery life. I just use it for the occasional call so I can't comment on the features. I do not know if there is anything else needed to get it working since mine was already used, and I would get another because I have seen some decent prices around.",positive
"Got this phone for temporary use while travelling in the US. Difficult to activate - had to call AT&T when the online activation wouldn't work - took 20 minutes on the phone with a very friendly AT&T associate to activate, mainly because I didn't save the plastic box it came in so didn't have the UPC number! Texting is a nightmare with cheap keys and no Qwerty keyboard. Menus are difficult to follow and aren't logical. I even found it difficult to answer when someone called. Can't wait to get home to my iPhone... BEst just to go to a store and buy one there already activated and ready to go. It's now known in my family as the StopPhone.",positive
"First of all I need to delete my lst review since there was much confusion when I tried to activate this phone with Verizon. This phone does not go by IMEI, it goes by DEC and HEX, the Verizon rep didn't look on Verizon guildelines as I finally did but thought it was an obsolete phone. The problem was Verizon's not the seller. The 2nd Verizon rrep got the phone activated. The seller called me and asked me to remove my negative comment which I am attempting to do. I ended up returning the phone because it wouldn't hold the charge. The seller generously gave me not only my sale price but refunded both postage to and from the seller.",negative
"The phone arrived with some scratches on the front and back, and I was a little disappointed when I saw the keypad was weathered and worn more than I'd like, but considering it's an 8+ year old phone, it's in very good condition. The screen, dial pad, speaker, everything works as it should. Had no problem activating it on to my existing verizon account. The included charger works great, however the battery was pretty weak, it only lasts about 10 hours or so on a full charge. Just order a replacement battery to be safe, (they're a few bucks) the phone lasts for days now with the new battery. Good phone though, good seller",positive
"I have this "" sane phone "" in "" Paris Hilton Red "". The Phone is "" Simply Awesome "" . Has "" All Great Cell Phone Features '.

"After only having this phone for a month it won't charge. First of all I ordered a pink one for my daughter and it arrived in silver. The charger that was included was clearly not the factory Motorola charger. When I plug in the phone now it displays a message saying that it is unable to charge. I have not tried an alternate charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. The one that came with the phone should work.",positive
The phone I ordered was suppose to be pink and is bright red. The condition on the item description was good and the one I received states average on the order sheet because the back of the phone is scratched up. This was also a christmas gift that now will not be on time. Huge dissapointment!!!!!,positive
"DISAPOINTED! phone was great, but the ""new"" battery wouldn't hold a charge long before dying. This was for my 78 yr old disabled dad and he can't use it. Too much of a hassle spent charging all the time.",positive
"Horrible purchase. Came today and first thing I noticed is it is far from ""like new"". Looks like my 5 yr old has been playing with it a few yrs. Avoid at all costs. I guess its cheap for a reason. Dont waste your money",positive
Verizon cannot hook up that phone any more. Too old and not powerful enough. Verizon said no more with those phones. You shipped what I asked for so not your fault.,negative
Lovely memories are in my hand!,positive
"Bought this phone used (but claimed to be refurbished), and it was supposed to be fully tested and functional. It is not. First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned. No more used phones, nor dealing with sellers of these products.",negative
the cell phone is broken,negative
Got it in the mail way way late and then I charged it over night. I went to turn it on and it would light up on the front screen but only for a second and then go black. I never could get it to turn on and wasn't able to hook it up to the line I needed it on. Returns take forever and I really needed a phone so I wound up having to just buy another one. Money doesn't grow on trees. When you buy a product that they guarantee is in working condition they should make sure it is.,positive
I bought this for my mom. She had a smartphone but didn't like it. She loves this phone and it isn't in to bad of condition. It can be a little glitchy at times and had also turned off for no reason a couple times. The charging port is very loose and that could be reason it randomly turns off. It is a used phone and I dont think I would get another one.,negative
Bad battery and other problems,negative
"Nice phone, suck company.",negative
"This phone was advertised as Used - Mint Condition!!! When I received it, the phone looked like new and I was very excited to put the battery in and let it charge before calling my phone company to make the transfer. Once the back was removed, the phone was clearly a REFURBISHED phone from the manufacturer. Reluctantly, I placed the battery and let it charge for 12 hours until it said charge complete. I turned the phone on and let it sit for 24 hours without using it. The next day, it was totally drained. I repeated the steps again to just be sure and this time, I let the phone charge for 24 hours. Again ,I left the phone and low and behold, it was totally drained. This phone was either damaged, or had a battery problem which I will never know. I will not buy from these people again. I have to now pay for a return shipping and waste more time taking it to UPS and wait for the credit to be issued.....AGGRAVATING.....",negative
"This phone is great. Does just what it should and I think it is better made than most of the lower end phones a person can buy now days. They seem to be more fragile, lighter weight and cheaply made. This phone takes really nice pictures, too. It isn't iPad quality, but for the price I am very happy.",positive
Good phone! Phone arrived kind of dirty but phone works great!,positive
"Bought this for my parents who were reluctant to try a smartphone when their razr stopped working on their provider. Didn't work. Gave 3 stars because the seller tried to make it right but the second didn't work either. Oh well, I tried.",negative
"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.",positive
"Very delayed, asked if it had any noticeable defects knowing it was refurbished/used, but was assured it worked great. Extremely delayed navigating from contacts to messages, and so on. Going to have to buy another phone.",positive
"This is an old school Motorola phone, but works well and is reliable. The only thing I am not crazy aout is that the battery doesn't last long. It really needs to be plugged in each night. I bought a newer battery, but it still doesn't last that long.",positive
I really like this phone. It has better reception than my last phone. Less dropped calls and clearer voice reception. Like the size and how easily it opens. I am even getting used to the pink color.,positive
Worked pretty good. A little laggy though and sometimes it seemed as though I would text too fast for it to keep up. I still enjoyed it though.,positive
I was not able to activate the phone (the numbers I needed off of the back were missing).Some numbers on the phone did not work. I had to pay for shipping to receive it and to ship it back. I was only refunded the amount I paid for the phone.,positive

"Motorola razr gets a 4 star, basic flip phone, easy to activate. Device can take a memory card for music and photos. That was a nice surprise. Haven't used it yet to give an first hand opinion.

"I specifically ordered this particular phone because of the ""little to no scratches"" , not the case here. Screen is scratched inside and out, the phone looks like it was dropped on the corners a dozen times at least, scratches on the back also.

"I purchased this rather basic piece of equipment ""used"" assuming that the risk of defect was low. I got burned. The device will not power down completely without pulling the battery. Also, the battery is completely depleted after approx 30 mins of talk. The only reason I didn't returned it is because I had already given it to my elderly mother. Plus, I didn't want to expend more of my valuable returning it. The cost was less than $50.",negative
"I bought this for my husband because he doesn't like or want a smartphone. He had an older version of this phone, many years old, and it lasted forever until the battery finally gave out. For about $50 more I was able to get him this new one. It is a great little phone, very slim and light, and the camera and standard features work great. Would recommend for someone who just wants a phone for making and receiving calls, simple texts, and a few pictures here and there.",positive
"The phone arrived just within the time frame for delivery. The outside was in excellent condition and looked almost new. The inside, however, was dirty and had traces of chocolate!

RAZR phone was just as advertised. Used but like-new condition with just a couple of scratches. Shipped promptly as advertised. Having this replacement phone really has saved us from upgrading to a more expensive contract. Verizon staff transferred all the phone numbers with ease at no cost. Thanks Golden Net !,positive

I ordered this because my current RAZR V3m was not reliable in receiving a signal. After several days I began having the same problem. At first I thought it was Verizon but obviously it's not. I have absolutely no complaints with the vendor.,negative
"It doesn't know when it gets closed, all features related to opening and closing don't work. I knew it was used, but not broken.",positive
Broke within two weeks not a great product used,negative
"Phone is fine, it works and looks good. No damage. Its just that the battery didn't hold a decent charge. You'd think they would test the battery on it or leave notes saying battery isn't good.",positive
"Did work, but not correctly. Shut off at will waste of money.",positive
"This phone doesn't stay charged and when the battery gets low it will not send text without notification the text didn't send. Has cause major headaches!! Sorry I got rid of my other phone, it worked much better than this one.",positive
"no one could program it so sent t back, case was a waste. was with out a phone for 10 days.",negative
I love this phone! I've purchased many over the years and this is the nicest. Exactly as described.,positive
"I had a phone like this before ,and had no problems, this phone even with a new battery with not hold a charge, I would never buy a used cell phone again. It has been plugged into the wall more than used to talk on.",negative
Fast shipping.Phone was in great shape as described.I just wanted a basic phone and this one is perfect.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a basic phone.,positive
"Phones lasted only a few days each; back light out, difficulty in charging. Waste of money, time & effort. Do not recommend.",negative
Piece of crap. Should have known better. It worked for a while BUT started going crazy. I don't recamend. Nope,negative
the battery just keeps going dead so fast. I think yall sold me a defect battery,negative
"I am not a texter so this phone is perfect. Flat, easily fits pockets and all menus are and controls are clearly understandable.",positive
Good little phone,positive
Thanks,positive
"I don't like that you can't personalize anything on the phone. Not settings, not layout, not directional keys, nada. It's difficult to navigate and doesn't have the wide variety of options for viewing messages by contact vs individual message. You also cannot send or I think receive video messages. Has a decent camera however. Also with a used phone the battery life and the battery itself are crap. Wouldn't make this purchase again but is a good phone to get you day to day if yours is broken/defaulty like my old one was.",negative
The phone arrived very well packaged. I activated the phone and it work perfect. The phone was in such great condition it look like it was new.,positive
This phone will not be usable without buying a new battery. This was a waste of money. I would not buy a used phone on Amozon again.,negative
Happy with the purchase.,positive
"This is a great phone. I got exactly what I wanted. I have used it every day, good stinking phone.",positive
I like the small thin design as it fits neatly in my shirt pocket and meets all my wireless needs.,positive
The volume control never worked. Replacement sent and after 1 month white bar across the screen. Was cheap but not worth it all the time wasted and we ended up buying an unused/unopened phone from another seller. Customer service was good but product not.,positive
"Good, reliable & exactly what I ordered.",positive
Works great no problems what so ever I love it,positive
Do not waist your time and money on this product. Phone did not come with a serial number so I cannot use the phone. The sender is not giving me the option to return it either. I'm calling amazon.,negative
"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",negative
"The one works. It smells like cigarettes. I bought it ""like new"". There's a numerous amount of deep scratches. & there's still photos from the orinial user that I cannot delete",positive
"Yes, I was very glad to have my ""old"" phone back. ther were a bunch of old calls on it. I called a couple of them (in Ohio) and then deleted them",positive
"The cell phone worked fine,but when I went to Verizon I could not activate this phone on my plan. I would highly recommend not ordering cell phones from this seller.",positive
"Good at the time I use them, but now they are not needed.",positive
"The phone could not be activated because, after a number of attempts, the sales person at the Verizon store said it was too old. .",negative
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PHONE. IT ONLY STAYS CHARGED FOR SO LONG. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.,negative
"This item was purchased several months ago and has never worked. I am the mother of the under age child who hit the button to purchase this phone with a credit card she had saved on Amazon. She did not have permission or authority (our fault) to purchase it. When it came and we (parents) found out about it, the battery was dead and would not hold a charge of any kind. To use the phone it had to be plugged in. What's the purpose of having a cell (cordless) phone if you have to leave it plugged in to use? I think the person who sold her this phone knew this and wanted to dump it off on any sucker who nibbled on it.",negative
I want AT&T phone,positive
"First of all, this section is for rating of a MOTO RAZR, NOTHING ELSE. STOP complaining about poor shipping speeds and bad customer service. If you got a bum deal on a used phone, wake up people, you get what you pay for! Now my review: I paid $20 for a USED Moto Razr, and it was a screaming deal! The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone. DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics. They are rating the shipping time of the phone and that is NOT what these reviews are for. Deal with it. PHONE RATING: 5 STARS. Keep in mind- these are OLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES! Did you really think they would work just like new?! FOOLS!",negative
"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.",positive
Why is this a best seller in 2018?,positive
"My original one still works fine, but the paint has worn off, so it looks old. The two (supposedly) new ones do not ring. My son is lucky, his works fine. So if you want to chance it, get one, if vibrate is good for you. I'm back to using my original one bought a long time ago from Motorola. Great phone if it really is from Motorola and is new. I doubt it.",positive
"I wasted the $90 I spent on this phone. The keypad became nonfunctional over about four months. First the green button that makes a call, then certain numbers, then the directional arrows. If you drop the phone even once, on any surface, it won't turn on until you remove and put back the battery, and even then it's finicky. Most of the claimed features do not come w/the phone. You have to have the Motorola syncing software.",negative
"Please be careful if you choose to purchase this phone. I purchased 2, one for my mom, and one for myself..I purchased these because they were advertised as Verizon compatible. When I took them to Verizon to have them activated, they could not activate them...they are only compatible with TMobile, and one other signal. I do not want anyone else getting screwed over.",negative
Just looking at the price is shocking... These dinky phones were po,negative
"I purchased this RAZR as a replacement for my husband's that is falling apart. We are trying to lower out bills and reduce our wireless costs by going back to our basic phones. I got the phone and all accessories very timely, BUT... I call Verizon to activate the phone and they tell me it is in use. What the he**?!?!?! A huge waste of $80 being we can't even use it. VERY UPSET and DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!! Seriously... how can it be in use if I have the phone in my possession? Anyway... SUCKS and never again!!!!",negative
"Ordered this phone and thought I was getting a good deal, till it showed up and the phone had no battery. Now I have to go and purchase a battery for it... Be careful who you order from!!",positive
"It didn't work when received. Took it to the verizon store, THEY could not make it work, sent it back for a refund !!!! I wanted it because of the slim design. I carry my phone in my pocket, wish it HAD worked !!",positive
Arrived in good shape and works just fine!,positive
I really love this phone always have since Verizon first came out with the Motorola RAZR V3m. Nice and slim fits in my jeans pocket nicely. Great sound loaded with features. GREAT! AAA+++,positive
Phone looked brand new. No problem at Verizon with activation. If you have the correct USB cable for this phone bring it with you. I had to transfer contacts one at a time via bluetooth since that required two cables for them to do and they only had one.,negative
Battery wouldn't hold a charge for even a full day. tried buying replacement batteries from other companies had same problems. If trying to use bluetooth with any of the batteries phone would shut off and not turn back on unless you removed and put the battery back in. Tried to return to the seller: Dealscaly but they refused. Wasted my money.,negative
"My sweetheart had one of these since 2005. Recently, the phone ceased being capable of charging its battery (even a new one). I secretly suspect that she had plugged an unauthorized charger into it, ruining the charger electronics. Her contract with Verizon was well past two years, so she was eligible for a free phone. We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had. This product filled the bill exactly. It is the spitting image of her old phone and every feature works great. It was thoroughly clean outside and all previous numbers and data had been removed inside. She loves her `new' (reconditioned) phone! My sweetheart is 76.",positive
Definitely was able to use this phone for awhile.,positive
"Still a fun old school phone, still has that click open cache.",positive
"This phone was in GREAT condition! I appreciate the seller, saling the item they advertised. I received it in a great amount of time. I would advise anyone that want to buy used electronics to use this seller. I am more that satisfied and look for to using them possibly in the future.",positive
"The phone was fine. We had it turned on and contacts switched over. The cover of the battery would not stay on, and the charger that came with the phone did not work. We had an old charger for a RAZR to charge the phone. We are returning it and hoping to get another one. Would have been happier to have just switched out the backing and charger. I had contacted the company had no problem getting responses.",positive
"Purchased used - this review is not about the phone in particular, but in the one received from the seller. Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash. Moral of the story is that if you have issues, be sure to get ahold of the seller right away.",positive
I currently own an ALLTEL Motorola V3c. I love that phone and since Verizon disabled it I cannot use it. The V3c is nothing like the V3m. The battery needs to be on the charger at all times. This is the 2nd V3m I have purchased since my original phone was disabled and they are both junk. I will resign to the fact that this phone has NO extras and drains the battery continuously. I wish I could remove that star.,positive
"Exactly what I wanted. However, it was advertised as being purple, and arrived silver. OK for me as I like silver. Needed to buy battery as the one in the phone would not hold the charge very long.",positive
"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in pink). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought. Different products, exact same problem.",negative
I haven't had the phone turned on yet but it arrived on time and in great condition its for my 73 year old mom in law she is so excited about getting a new phone so prayerfully Verizon won't have any trouble turning it and transferring her old service to this phone.,positive
not happy,negative
"I often have trouble doing a review - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am pleased with my experience with this seller. The item was just as described, shipped in a very reasonable time frame and the price was reasonable.",negative
I have had 4 of these at a time on my family plan over the years and needed to replace a lost Razr and let me I was not disappointed in getting this Razr. Always reliable and small enough to fit in the smallest pockets!,positive
Dead battery basically worthless,negative
"I replaced my older RAZR V3m that I dropped on concrete with this exact duplicate. It's a great little phone if you don't want or need all the bells and whistled. And for the price, a very good deal.",positive
"I can find no other cell phone as durable as the RAZR. SInce I don't need a Smart Phone in my life, the metal case makes this my #1 Choice. I hope the cell systems always provide support so I can keep on using the phone I swear by.",positive
Very disappointed to find out from Verizon that this is not a Verizon phone. Feels like I just handed over money for nothing.,negative
"My dad loves his razor so Mich, o had to find a replacement one when his quit working.. Thank you amazon for still having one!!",positive
"Loved it and had it for a long time until Verizon wouldn't give me good service. I was persuaded to change, otherwise I would've kept it forever.",positive
okay but I had to order a new battery which I did through Amazon and it was brand new and it works great now.,positive
"Ended up in the trash --- had charging problems, took it in to Verizon, and the charger outlet in the phone was broken.",negative
Its a pre paid phone so was unable to activate it through our provider. Wish I would have known :(,positive
GREAT TO TROLL WITH,positive
"I originally bought this phone 6 or 7 yrs. ago and I loved it. I must have dropped it a gazillion times and it worked great for the first five or so years. I had to pray over it to get it to last the additional year. I really did pray over it. The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning. So basically, if you need a phone to do just about everything except download apps, this is the phone to get.",positive
The phone can not work very well. Battery runs out so fast. I need to charge it everyday even I didn't make any calls and receive any calls. My friends always complain a lot of noises. I need to switch to other Verizon phone to be able hear well.,negative
I needed a simple but uesful phone. If you don't need a smart phone but one that is waht phones were ment to be this one is good.,positive
"I guess you get what you pay for (t was used, and refurbished). It was a real bargain. However it took about 6 months to break.",positive
I needed to get a basic phone and this one meets my expectation. I would recommend this phone as a good basic phone.,positive
My dad used the parts from this to make another cell phone work and it works great! Got here very fast too!,positive
"The Razor was clean and it very good condition, works well!",positive
"I got this to replaced a device I had (lost?) in a hospital. It arrived quickly was easy to reload with my phone book and took care of my needs until I was discharged.... Then I wanted it to link to my vehicle's Kenwood. I mean my previous (older) one did. Would not work, so I stopped at the local Verizon where the associate pulled out his smarter phone and quickly said, ""Your Bluetooth isn't working, no signal"". So that where I am, wish the sellar had fully check it out before selling (well I thought that was implied)!",positive
"the * button didnt work, but i paid 31 shipped, so i didnt want to give up that easy when i couldnt call *228 for verizon, but got it working. the seller left a few things out about the phones cosmetic blems, but the phone itself is sweet and for $31 shipped not only do you get what you pay for, its sharp for being a non smart phone. i got sick of replacing expensive phones and saving $30 a month for other things. the reason most this phone has such horrible reviews is due to the few crummy scam artist. take from it what you will.",negative
Great,positive
it was in very good condition for its age.,positive
I love my phone. It is a new one. I wish I could download songs. But Verizon stopped that. But I still love it.,positive
Excellent,positive
Like brand new,positive
i love my phone,positive
i love this phone but mostly i love the fact i paid $20. for it. i hate the idea of spending half a paycheck (500) on a device that lets people contact me at all hours of the day. plus i have already dropped it over 6 times and its still good,positive
So far so good.phone came in pristine condition cosmetically.all buttons working perfectly.newly manufactured battery (Chinese made).only down side is very small font size with no adjustments possible.otherwise its a mint old school razr and I love it.after 2weeks the supplied battery stopped taking a charge.the seller gave me a refund.picked up an aftermarket battery and the phone is fine.quick service no questions asked.,positive
Nice basic phone. It is just a little too out dated. Reception is a little poor but if that is the phone you want it was in good condition.,positive
works like it should. The battery was not good but that is a minor issue.,positive
thank you,positive
Not the condition it was stated to be in. Barely holds a charge on the battery. Disappointed in this purchase.,negative
The phone was great and the seller did a good job,positive
Much better than I expected for being used. Bought one mew last year an you couldn't tell the difference between the two.,positive
BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.,positive
I wish i could customize it a but more-front screen and all that- but its a flip phone and i like it. Battery isnt the best. Especially for a basic phone. I activated it on verizon prepaid plan no trouble at all with the DEC instead of an imei. I thing it was like quality used phones? I do love it so far,positive
Was dirty but worked fine.,negative
"One of the best phones I have owned, this is my THIRD one ever since Motorola came out with it.",positive
We still have these type phones in our family and I'm glad we found one. We keep this one in reserve in case the others bomb out on us in the future. You really can't get these anymore and we don't want the new kind at this time.,negative
thank you for the corrections that you made on my order & for sending the rest of my items very very quickly. i will def recommend your store! thank you again.,positive
This is the second review it is the same as the first one . It worked well for the first two weeks not so well now. The condition of the phone cosmeticly is not desirable. However we are stuck with it and have to live with it. 😡,positive
"the phone is awesome, amazing, and easy to read. the signal and function is special. i just love this phone, and will order many more products from you.",positive
"I still need to upgrade , but my razr needed replacing. This one saved me a lot of money Thanks",positive
This was bought as a new in the box and it was new. They did not disclose that the manual was not in the box. The phone works great,positive
"this being the 2nd phone in the past 2 weeks that we have bought, we were once again let down. It arrived in a timely manner but the battery wouldn't charge AT ALL. The buttons on the side were loose and it was supposed to be a brand new phone. The seller was very apologetic when we contacted him about the phone and we are able to return it for a refund. Maybe we just got a lemon. That would be our luck..",positive
Actually it doesn't even deserve 1 star. Very disappointed. It will not hold a charge at all..thanks a lot for selling me a piece of crap.🙁,negative
"The V3m is still one of the best non-smart phones available. Long battery life, invisible in a pocket, no issues with call loss. All the bases covered. Whats not to like. Great phone!",negative
it does the job. a old type model.small phone and small screen.but it does the job.the razor v3m. was a good phone then but your choices are limited to what is a basic phone today,positive
"gets good signal and good sound ez to use , i loved this phone. and now they are making me type more stuff so they will post it and i HATE this !",positive
"Excellent service, I called them about an issue and they went above and beyond to help solve! Phone works great! Thank you!",positive
"I purchased a phone that was ""used, in good condition"". I paid extra for expedited 2 day shipping. After 4 days the phone had not yet shipped. I emailed the contact inquiring when the product would ship but received no response. When the product finally arrived I discovered that the key pad did not work, I could only intermittently key in a command and when I did hit send for *228, to activate it with Verizon, the phone never actually rang but simply hung up. In addition, the screen would freeze up and go between frozen to blank white. Terrible responsiveness, show shipment, defective product. And the most frustrating piece of this was that I selected this seller specifically b/c they had received high marks for ALL of these characteristics in all of the previous reviews other than one 3 of 5 for slow shipment. This is very frustrating!",negative
Missing center button and no charger.,negative
"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver).

Different products, exact same problem.",positive
I bought this phone for my great aunt because it was something simple for her rather than the o ne she had at the time. It charges fast and the battery lasts all day. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple easy to use flip phone,positive
"I purchased these 2 additional phones as replacements for the current ones my sweetheart keeps destroying....over & over & over. I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible. (K.I.S.S.) These are OK phones and for emergencies it takes care of that requirement. The cell service itself is normal & adequate. Yes I would recommend it to anyone as an emergency phone.",positive
"I got this for my mom and she's thrilled. We switched from Verizon about half a year ago to another carrier. However, due to reception issues, we switched her back to verizon, but this time prepaid. The prices for Verizon's prepaid per minute are not as great as the previous carrier, but this phone is great! It's almost identical to my mom's contract samsung phone, which lasted her years, except this phone is a little more up to date. The reception is just as great as it was with our contract phones too. It's a great basic phone, and if you told me it was a contract phone I would believe you in a second. It has a great feel to it as well. I'm very pleased.",negative
"This phone has a lot of functionality. It is Very small. Great for an emergency pay-as-you-go phone which is what we were looking for at the time. Totally programmable and very easy to understand and manage online. I am sure if one wanted to call Verizon to activate and ask questions about the phone and service, it would be equally satisfactory. My experience is with online activation and teaching my elderly father to use this phone in an emergency. The ring is loud enough to be heard, the speaker is loud enough to be heard and it is small and functional.",positive
"Arrived on time or sooner,in original container as in any store.Also to my surprise ,included ""2"" Freebies ,an car charger and earplug....... Very fast registration with verizon wireless via the phone itself and also online for ""my account"".......Also includes call blocking and your phone id # stealthing.............. Beats Tracfone lol.....",positive
works well,positive
"MY MOM LOVES THIS PHONE, IT SERVED IT'S PURPOSE BUT WHEN WE CHECKED IT, SHE WAS USING ENOUGH MINUTES THAT A PLAN WAS CHEAPER SINCE CALL TO CALL FROM THE SAME COMPANY IS FREE.",positive
The only problem I have is getting a hold of the top to flip the top open to answer it but other then that it is an excellent phone I am happy with it.,positive
"It's got a camera, it's easy to figure out, it allows a thousand one, two, or three button shortcuts (which is overkill, but hey). For the price, it does more than I would've expected.",positive
"The phone was for my mother and she says it's works great! I would give it a 5 star, however, they sent the wrong kind of charger and we had to go out and get another one. Other than that, everything is great!",positive
WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET THE SAME PHONE THAT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN FROM ME GOD BLESS YOU FOR HAVING THIS PHONE,positive
Completely satisfied. Product works well. Shipping was prompt & was received by promised date. Very satisfied.,positive
"I had foolishly expected that something would come with it to let me know how to make it work. But there was nothing at all, and since I've never used a disposable phone, and don't have a regular cell phone, it's worthless to me. Thanks a lot..",negative
"a nice little phone, when all you need is a phone.",positive
bought it as a gift,positive
Easy to use - works well!,positive
pruduct has eye appeal & nice features.My oops was that I ordered it for my reachout wireless government phone line as an upgrade.I was not aware that verizon makes there own phones where reachout wireless does not & uses other companies phones.if you order a new verizon phone[verizon is reachouts carrier]they will not release that phone to any other company until you have completed a 6 month contract.if you have a reachout government assisted mobil phone & want to upgrade you are better off ordering one out of there website.the phone itself I liked & wish it would have worked for me.an easy 4 stars rating.Sk8rBoi,positive
its good and i am satisfied with my purchase. It has the basic phone functions which were my requirement from the phone.,positive
It was great!!! I was very happy!!!,positive
This phone might be OK for some purposes but was NOT suitable for Page Plus service. It was conveniently returned without problems,positive
"Crawfords Superstore advertised a cell that looked identical to my Verizon flip-top phone, with one exception ... this was a wireless device with online capability, which I don't want (yeah, I know!), I discovered this, reading the packaging, though they had clearly said 'wireless' phone in the ad. (Yeah, I know!) When the phone arrived, I realized my error, and contacted the seller immediately. I sent the phone back pronto. But I have received only generic responses from the seller, Crawfords Superstore, to my communications. Maybe they credited my credit card ... I hope so. But I thought I would get s o m e kind of acknowledgment. Too impersonal. Maybe I am dreaming, expecting communication. Could be; doesn't impress me.",positive
The item was not able to activate. Because the item was already activated by someone. I had to go Verizon service center and spent long time to cancel previous use and activate for my use. Please do clean business. Do not sell used one as a new.,positive
"This phone is fine if you just want to use the prepaid plans, but if you want to activate an existing account (which I did) verizon will not allow you to do that until you have used the prepaid plan on this phone for 6 months. Not for people with existing contracts looking for a cheap way to replace their broken or lost phones. Not too many used options on Amazon for cheap phones, it is better to go to ebay if you want a used phone",positive
You said there was no contract and you have to get a new one too use this !!!!!!!! I have a contract all ready and I just wanted to use this phone temporaley .So I bought this phone for nogthing Not happy !!!!!!!!!,negative
"cant be connected to verizon, the Meid number is in conflict with verizon, cannot use phone. is it possible to return",negative
I did not want a prepaid phone -- I wanted a Samsung U340 cell phone Verizon all purpose cell phone. I guess I would like an exchange this phone for a,positive
I received this phone so quickly I could hardly believe it! I would definitely order from you again!,positive
"If you just want a phone to keep in your purse in case of emergencies, this is it. After getting totally fed up with Tracfone, I bought this. It's easy to put money on (which was my gripe with Tracfone. With this phone you program in your credit card number and once a month I punch in $15. Case closed, so to speak), has good reception and battery life, and customer service, the one time I've needed it in almost a year, was great. It's not fancy, but it serves its purpose well. And it can be even fancier than I usually need it to be, with pictures and text. I just bought two for Christmas presents (for 9.99 elsewhere - don't pay Amazon prices!)",positive
"Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA. I resurrected my Motorola with a cheap OEM battery I got online, which I will continue to use.",negative
"The Samsung Smooth Verizon prepaid phone shocked me when I realized that I bought this phone for $10.00 and I NEVER lose a signal no matter where I go. The phone takes pictures also. Not the best but that is not what I purchased the phone for. This phone has all that I need to communicate with others via text or calling. I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it. What I also love about this phone is that I text over 1000 texts a month. I only pay $20.00 a month for a text bundle. I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what. I love the Samsung Smooth with the Verizon service. Never lose a call or miss one, I can text all day long, every day for only $20.00 a month, and all of the extras that I described above. It is worth every cent that I pay for it.",positive
"I'm on my 3rd one with Verizon -- this one bought new as prepaid, had to wait 6 months to activate with regular Verizon (blocked before that). Excellent phone, but old technology means you can't backup or restore contacts -- verified at a Verizon store. Darn.",positive
This phone has lasted me three years and it's only now starting to cause me problems. And that's probably because I don't treat it too well. I'm most likely going to buy the same phone to replace it.,negative
"The Samsung Smooth has a great battery life and is built well. It is easy to learn and use and has good quality sound. It even has a decent signal at my house even though I live right on the border of a National Park. I get an excellent signal elsewhere. Remember, this is a great basic phone - it is not a Blackberry or a Droid. Bob - Akron OH",positive
"I don't know how I lost this amazing phone but I prefer THIS so-called ""old"" phone to the shiny new iphone. It really is a phenomenal device.",negative
The case is so smooth and tapered it is very hard to grasp to flip open. The keys are also hard to push you have to press just right.,negative
I purchased a Samsung Smooth Verizon cell phone about 7 months ago and remain very happy with it. I needed a cheap plain cell phone to carry with me when traveling and did not want to pay a monthly charge just to have an emergency phone. I put $100 worth of minutes on the phone when I purchased it and 7 months later still have $78 left. As for my limited use this phone has worked very well for me. I even purchased one for a friend to carry with them for emergencies.,positive
"I usually have no problems ordering through amazon. Very happy with your products. But, this one time, I was not satisfied. The phone was not damaged on the outside and you could use all your features. The problem I had is it would not stay charged. I would fully charge the phone, make one call and it would die. Than I could put the phone down for the night, fully charged, in the morning their would be no energy. I could not use this phone.",negative
"No stating that this phone has the old style charge connection,, of which is not compatible with the latest. Meaning- the cord does nt fit into any other amsung device.",positive
"Got the phone for my mom, she needed a cell phone to just make phone calls, she don't text. Received it took it down to Verizon Wireless and got it activated for her. Phone is great for her and there was no hassle activating the phone with Verizon Wireless. If needing a basic phone to use, I highly recommend this phone.",positive
"Brought this phone for my sister, it was her first phone ever. She had no problems with it. For a standard flip phone, it's pretty simplistic. Aside from texting and making calls there's not too much else you can do. Picture quality wasn't the greatest, but considering the price and type of phone, it really wasn't bad.",positive
"This phone is ideal for someone who needs a phone to use as a phone. The camera, texting and internet capabilities all work great, but the best part is that the phone does so well. Very satisfied.",positive
"I found out the hard way, that you can not activate the phone with carrier, only use with buying of prepaid cards ONLY. On all prepaid phone from Verizon.",negative
greatbphone. It is just what we were looking for. Thanks for sending so promptly. It is much appreciated. Thanks again,positive
We were warned by verizon not to buy outside their company because the others were not reliable. Well these phones are still being used and we loved them. they were pretty good.,positive
Several years old and still performing like it did the day we got it!,positive
Verizon wouldn't honor the phone,negative
Love me some trusty flip-phones!,positive
"This is a great phone for those like me who want an inexpensive phone with good sound. I appreciate a phone that is loud and clear enough to take phone calls in noisy places. The camera isn't all that hot, but better than most phones.The camera isn't important to me anyway. All in all a grat inexpensive phone.",positive
good phone,positive
phone works as expected. very low battery consumption,negative
Thank You,positive
I order it for my brother but he still said it was to small for him to see the numbers good but now i think he had my other brother to check it out and the setting was wrong on it but he is now not complaining so everything ok.,negative
Well worth the price and included a free $10 minutes card. Has all the functions I need and use. Economical.,positive
wrong item,negative
"This was a gift to be used for someone who doesn't use the phone often. It's durable, easy to function and serves the purpose well.",positive
Great little phone!,positive
I am sure the phone if fine but it did not work on our family plan. We sent it back and requested a refund.,positive
this phone is crap its prepaid and its 75$ and it doesnt even have unlimited features like what the heck ?!!?!,negative
Well i got this phone for my mother she happy with it. But I have had to use t a few times and the volume is low even when you have it turned all the way up. She only use it for phone calls because she doesn't text She can only read text when they come in if she hears it if not she has to ask some1 to retrieve it for her She almost 70,positive
1) I ordered two identical items. I received one item exactly as ordered and one with an extra attachment. It makes me want the 2nd attachment for the 2nd phone. 2) They arrived quickly and were packaged safely.,positive
I was amazed by how fast my phone was delivered. I received my phone within less than a week. I definitely recommend this seller. Thanks.,positive
This is a great phone i have had it for about a year no problems at all. I accually bought a different phone becuase i wanted a slide phone it has a better rating but its not near as good as this phone.the battery life is amazing last me 2-3 days of use. It has great sound quality. pretty much the best phone cuz there is little things about it that just make everything so easy to use. i give it a 6 out 5 i will buy again,positive
Worst Flip Phone I ever had. It is difficult to open and the sound is terrible. My old LG VX8300 is far better than this phone.,negative
"You can make calls whenever the phone doesn't slip out of your hand. Sound quality's fine, for the first few months. And then it starts to sound like everyone you call is cutting in and out. Are they having phone reception problems? Nope, it's your phone with the problem. The screen is a decent size for a phone at this price, but what's the point when you start getting extra lines across the screen after just a few months of use? The phone does tell time, though.",negative
This prepaid phone is good for emergency situations. Although i wish verizon gave more options with their prepaid plans. You cant get just talk anymore.,positive
"very good, no problems",positive
The phone is OK but the Verizon payment plan extracts a monthly payment whether you use the phone or not. I wasn't aware of the terms until my account was terminated and my $60 balance confiscated. All Verizon support would say was send us more money and we will reactivate your account. My recommendation: go to Walmart.,positive
When i first looked at the phone it was so bright it made my great grandma go blind. Everyday she would talk about a Giraffe chasing her. When i lift it it turned to celery.,positive
"This is a very basic phone, which is what I needed for my daughter going to camp. The ""Product Description"" says it includes $15 of airtime. When I didn't see the $15 in my account after activation I called AT&T, who said this phone does not include any airtime. I then called Amazon who confirmed the $15 airtime claim, but the Amazon rep told me I had to contact Samsung. Unfortunately, the number she gave me was for directory assistance.....I had to call India (I mean Amazon) back. Samsung said I had to deal with either Amazon or AT&T. I have since sent an inquiry to Amazon via email and will update this review. Sounds like someone is lying on the Amazon website. Update..... I just talked with Amazon who said they will give me $15 credit for future Amazon purchases, and will update the product description. When I asked why the 1st rep didn't offer the same solution, which would've saved me an hour of calling (and being on hold), he basically said that that was Amazon's policy and wanted the customer to exhaust all avenues. So, it's better to let customers do all of the legwork for an Amazon mistake and hope they are so frustrated that they simply give-up. Doesn't sound like good customer service to me.",positive
"We have 2 of these (my husband and I each have one) that we use in rural Alaska and they have lasted and lasted and lasted. Nice basic phone--nothing fancy if that's what you're looking for. Ours have been almost indestructible--great battery life, great reception, good size for fitting in a pocket, no screen on the outside to get scratched or broken. We have carried these while doing firewood, in and out of the boat in the ocean air, and dropped them more times than I can count. Trust me--if this was a flimsy phone my husband would have managed to break his a long time ago! We have had other inexpensive go phones that lasted a matter of weeks, not years like these have. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone who wants a durable, reliable phone that does what a phone is supposed to do.",positive
"Phone works off the AT&T network. After bringing the phone to AT&T, they said it is a 2G network phone which they do not support anymore since 2014. Therefore, the phone will not work with AT&T.",negative
"For my parents visiting, I ordered this phone from a vendor named ""classicsale10"". The shipping was fast. The phone is completely out of date but still meet the basics - calling and texting. The battery lasts long. And it feels good to touch the ""real keys"" again...touch screens are just cold and hard. I only hope this phone would have volume control...and the sound to be louder. Real problem is, the product detail said that this package contains $15 airtime credit. So I activated the phone...and, nothing. Then I waited to see if any msg will come later, like the other buyer said in his/her comment. A night was gone, and still nothing. Then I contacted the seller. They replied by saying that ""AT&T has withdrawn this $15 airtime credit for the devices launched in the market in recent times. The listing was created when the AT&T was giving the free airtime credit. "" Well, although I don't completely understand this but it's not my resposbility for the $15 loss. So after negotiation the seller quickly agreed to refund me $15 though they will lose money. Sorry about that. Blame AT&T, maybe. Anyways, it's a good deal.",positive
"Straight off: SIM card was a dud and had to be replaced at an AT & T store, where I should have gone in the first place. The manual icons are nearly impossible to make out; the menu is not straight-forward; and no mention is made about obtaining a phone number. I ""chatted"" with an on-line agent who was useless, essentially. I just needed an emergency car phone; so this seemed ideal. We'll see.",positive
"Used this as a holdover phone when my old one broke before I could upgrade to my next smartphone. Pros: - Is a phone. - Is cheap. - Good sound quality. Cons: - Doesn't withstand hammers? - Some people apparently have issues with the $15 credit not being applied. If you ask me, $30 for a phone is a great deal regardless.",positive
"This is a very basic cell phone that I purchased as a replacement for my son. He has no interest in taking photos or using the internet with his phone, so it is perfect for him. There is not much else to say about it, it's very basic and it works.",positive
"If you just want a basic phone for talking and you don't expect to talk for more than 80 minutes per month, this is the perfect phone for you. It is compact and simple to use. AT&T's GoPhone option of paying $100 for 1,000 minutes once a year cannot currently be beat.",positive
"this is the second time ive purchased this phone. its a great basic for phone calls, but not much else. its sturdy and the battery lasts a long time. my only disappointment is that this time, the seller didnt offer a $15 airtime credit with the phone purchase. bummer.",negative
"I bought this phone to use it during my holiday in the US. The phone is simple and was used only for calling and sending txt messages (it is possible to download some applications, but I did not test it). The phone had no difficulties to find network in California (from LA to San Francisco), battery held approx. for 10 days (phone was always on, but only few calls were made and few txts sent), quality of sound was very good. The phone fell once on the ground from ca. 1 meter and no harm was made (not even a small scratch). I bought it with 15 USD credit for calls and sms, and taking into account that total phone price was lower than that, it was a great buy.",positive
"The phone/service works well in New York, but in some parts there was no signal. Boston is great and niagara falls worked great. Sound is low so could not hear other person very well but the battery lasts a long time 8+ hours with constant 20 minute calls.",positive
"My mom does not like a complicated phone, and it is nearly impossible to get a non-smart phone. So when her original phone gave out, I bought this an inexpensive replacement. Everyone is happy",positive
"Bought this for my mom as a substitute phone for a few weeks, and I'm glad that's how long we needed it for, since the phone was pretty much done for after three weeks.",positive
"I received the GoPhone very quickly but unfortunately I hasnt been very reliable. luckily I bought it as an extra phone incase one of our phones (smartphones) started acting up and sure enough, 2 days later, my daughters phone started tripping..the problem is the phone wont allow us to hear the person on the other side. it doesnt happen all the time but once a day is too much. we never know when it will act up also. So i cannot recommend this phone with the experience weve had so far.",negative
"Was looking for a dirt-simple phone. Delivery was excellent - arrived early. Set-up rather confusing. Samsung instructions not the best. ATT is a real PITA! Registration and credit for included minutes took 18 hours and two phone calls. Internet access is the easiest function on the phone - so easy you must be very very careful not to make the connection (and get charged for it!). There is no way to disable this function, so plan on paying for internet minutes whether you want it or not.",positive
"About a week ago I purchased my phone not only was the shipping extremely fast but the phone itself was worth much more than I payed for , it was such an amazing deal that for a while I actually believed it was false until I actually received the phone. The phone came brand new in perfect condition and worked like a charm , all in all Theres not that much to say other than the simple fact that I am extremely happy with this purchase and recommend this seller to everyone and hope to buy from him again. Thanks.",positive
all is well,positive
"I particularly like this phone because it is the physically smallest one I can find. I have difficulty finding replacements because I think they have stopped manufacturing this model. It has a good (severl days) battery life. The various features access is a little primative because you have to go through their tree for access, but that is okay with me. The item purchase through Amazon went smooth.",positive
"Loves these phones, have a tree service And we go through these phones all the time This seller seems to have what I need when I need Them. I would highly recommend this seller",positive
My wife loves it. She likes the battery life and size. Also cost is just right.,positive
Great product and service !,positive
"Having use the above cell phone for a month now, I am happy to say that is the best choice I ever made. It is portable and solid. The battery life is as just good. I do not have any problem whatsoever. I recommend it for anybody who wants a simple prepaid phone. It worth more than the price. Thank you. Customer.",positive
I have a pay as you go ATT phone that I needed to replace with a clam shell type. This phone has served its purpose well and was inexpensive.,positive
Works great,positive
"I love this phone. I love the different alarms that I need at different times. I am going to order again, so that I will always have one on hand.",positive
"First, I never got to use them because I only received one and, it wasn't new, as advertised, and it didn't come with everything needed to activate. So, I really can't give a high rating or any rating really. I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.",negative
Phone was OK other than being dropped in water. Would of liked to have known about that in the discrption.,positive
"Yes, this is a really ancient phone. It does still work and look great, and it was fine for our granddad. Remember, if you buy 1,000 minutes for $100 at AT&T, you'll probably have phone service for a year! If you don't talk much.",positive
i loved it and it came within 2 days and i didnt even order express shipping. a great buy :),positive
This item was not what it seem to be and I was very disappointed with the item.I didnt even get an earpiece,positive
